# Frequently asked questions
## How can I add bot to my server?

You can add the bot by visiting [this link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1005716197259612193).

## Why bot commands don't appear?
- Ensure your server has the bot and necessary permissions for the bot.
- If your server have more than 50 bots, remove some unnecessary bots and add the bot again. This is because Discord limits a server to [only having a maximum of the first 50 bots](https://github.com/discord/discord-api-docs/discussions/4883) using slash commands are shown commands.

## Why the music function load slowly?
This is because the bot generates the music card slowly. We will fix it as soon as possible!
